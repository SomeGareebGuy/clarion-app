# clarion-app

Probably something about tracking number of debates per person, so maybe a drop down menu for that, way to type in the motions that is to be done, the motion chosen (maybe a drop down that has 1/ 2/ 3 and thus automatically records these), and the record if gov wins or opp wins, and a way to access who has debated how many times.
